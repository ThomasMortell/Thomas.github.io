				<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beyzoc.vibrance">Vibrance</a> is an Android application that gives the user the pleasure to picking the wallpaper that suits them best. Vibrance looks to the community to help find wallpapers they think that are necessary for one to have. Vibrance also includes a blurr feature to help make the wallpaper appear in the background of your phone more rather than distracting you with it being in the foreground. Vibrance also has a variety of social features allowing people to share, like and comment on their favourite wallpapers.
